Both the ansi and unicode versions of the runtime methods were
modified in the same way.

setlocale functionality has been mostly obliterated.  setlocale cannot be used
to change the current locale, only to query it.

These functions have been completely removed:
    _diskfree_t (structure) removed
    _getdiskfree removed
    _seterrormode removed
    _beep removed
    _mbtow_environ removed
    _setargv removed
    _setenvp removed
    _loaddll removed
    _unloaddll removed

These functions are now unsupported.  For the time being, they exist in the
library, but they will fail when called:
    _chdir
    _getdrive
    _getdrives
    _chdrive
    _fullpath
    _getcwd
    _getdcwd
    validdrive
    _getpid
    all *spawn* methods
    all *exec* methods
    _cwait
    _system
    _locking
    _pipe
    _getenv
    _putenv
    _popen
    _pclose
    _setsystime
    _cgets
    _cprintf
    _cputs
    _cscanf
    _getch
    _getche
    _kbhit
    _putch
    _ungetch

_stat returns -1 for anything which is not a file
stdin, stdout, stderr will all produce EOF when used
assert forwards to RtlAssert
_searchenv looks only in the current directory
