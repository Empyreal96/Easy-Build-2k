*qsort.c - quicksort algorithm; qsort() library function for sorting arrays
*
*       Copyright (c) 1985-2001, Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.
*
*Purpose:
*       To implement the qsort() routine for sorting arrays.
*
*Revision History:
*       06-22-84  RN    author
*       03-25-85  RN    added pre-check for elements already in order to
*                       eliminate worst-case behavior.
*       05-18-86  TC    changed to recurse on the smallest piece to avoid
*                       piece. unneccesary stack usage, and to iterate on
*                       largest
*       01-09-87  BCM   fixed huge-array case where (num-1) * wid computation
*                       was overflowing (large/compact models only)
*       06-13-89  PHG   made more efficient, many more comments, removed
*                       recursion
*       10-30-89  JCR   Added _cdecl to prototypes
*       03-15-90  GJF   Replaced _cdecl with _CALLTYPE1 and added #include
*                       <cruntime.h>. Also, fixed the copyright.
*       04-05-90  GJF   Made shortsort() and swap() _CALLTYPE4. Also, added
*                       #include <search.h>.
*       10-04-90  GJF   New-style function declarators.
*       12-28-90  SRW   Added _CRUISER_ conditional around check_stack pragmas
*       01-24-91  SRW   Added missing close comment in swap procedure
*       11-19-91  GJF   Do the swap one character at a time to avoid alignment
*                       woes.
*       04-06-93  SKS   Replace _CRTAPI* with __cdecl
*       09-06-94  CFW   Remove Cruiser support.
*       02-27-98  RKP   Add 64 bit support.
*       01-04-99  GJF   Changes for 64-bit size_t.
*       05-10-00  PML   Performance improvements - middle-of-3 pivot choice,
*                       widen middle range equal to pivot, don't swap pivot to
*                       beginning (vs7#99674).
*       08-08-00  PML   Avoid calling comp(p,p), since some existing code
*                       doesn't expect that (vs7#123134).
