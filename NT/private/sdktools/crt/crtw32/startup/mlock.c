*Purpose:
*
*Revision History:
*       05-07-90  JCR   Module created.
*       06-04-90  GJF   Changed error message interface.
*       08-08-90  GJF   Removed 32 from API names.
*       08-08-90  SBM   _lockmap no longer 8 times required size
*       10-08-90  GJF   New-style function declarators. Removed questionable
*                       return statements from void functions (weren't needed
*                       and the compiler was bitching).
*       10-09-90  GJF   Thread ids are unsigned longs.
*       06-06-91  GJF   Adapted for Win32 [_WIN32_].
*       09-29-91  GJF   Fixed infinite recursion problem with DEBUG version
*                       of _lock [_WIN32_].
*       03-06-92  GJF   Removed _[un]lock_fh() and _[un]lock_stream for Win32
*                       targets.
*       05-28-92  GJF   Added _mtdeletelocks() for Win32 for DLLs with contain
*                       the C runtime (e.g., crtdll.dll).
*       10-06-92  SRW   Make _locktable an array of PCRITICAL_SECTION pointers
*                       instead of structures.  Allocate each critical section
*                       as it is needed.
*       02-25-93  GJF   Substantially revised. Restored static critical section
*                       structures for some locks. Replaced bit-array scheme
*                       of keeping track of locks. Removed Cruiser support and
*                       replaced obsolete DEBUG code.
*       03-03-93  GJF   Made CRITICAL_SECTION structure for _HEAP_LOCK static.
*       03-08-93  SKS   Fix ptr use error in DEBUG version of _mtdeletelocks
*       03-08-93  SKS   Fix deletion of the special critical sections,
*                       especially the heap lock.
*       04-06-93  SKS   Replace _CRTAPI* with __cdecl
*       05-05-93  GJF   Turned DEBUG code off.
*       06-03-93  SRW   Disable FPO optimizations for this file so it can call
*                       CriticalSection routines on a checked build even though
*                       the C Runtimes are compiled free.
*       10-19-93  GJF   Merged in NT SDK version. Enclosed #pragma-s in
*                       #ifdef _M_IX86 / #endif. Replaced MTHREAD with _MT.
*       04-12-94  GJF   Made into empty functions for the Win32s version of
*                       msvcrt*.dll.
*       01-10-95  CFW   Debug CRT allocs.
*       01-30-95  GJF   Made CRITICAL_SECTION structure for _SIGNAL_LOCK
*                       static.
*       03-06-95  GJF   Added _[un]lock_file[2] to lock stdio files (__piob[]
*                       entries).
*       03-23-95  BWT   Store the critsec in the locktable *after* it's
*                       initialized.
*       10-03-95  GJF   Added comments to the effect that the _LC_*_LOCK
*                       locks are obsolete.
*       11-15-95  JWM   Correct syntax error in 2nd '#pragma optimize()'.
*       06-19-97  GJF   Moved _[un]lock_file[2]() to stdio\_file.c to improve 
*                       granularity.
*       05-13-99  PML   Remove Win32s
*       10-14-99  PML   Replace InitializeCriticalSection with wrapper function
*                       __crtInitCritSecAndSpinCount
*       12-10-99  GB    Added a new Lock _UNDNAME_LOCK for critical section in
*                       unDName().
*       03-06-00  PML   Call __crtExitProcess instead of ExitProcess.
*       02-20-01  PML   vs7#172586 Avoid _RT_LOCK by preallocating all locks
*                       that will be required, and returning failure back on
*                       inability to allocate a lock.
*       03-07-01  PML   vs7#221122 Release preallocated locks after heap ones,
*                       so _HEAP_LOCK is around while we're still freeing mem.
*       03-22-01  PML   Add _DEBUG_LOCK for _CrtSetReportHook2 (vs7#124998)

/***
*_mtinitlocks() - Initialize multi-thread lock scheme
*
*Purpose:
*       Perform whatever initialization is required for the multi-thread
*       locking (synchronization) scheme. This routine should be called
*       exactly once, during startup, and this must be before any requests
*       are made to assert locks.
*
*       NOTES: In Win32, the multi-thread locks are created individually,
*       each upon its first use. That is when any particular lock is asserted
*       for the first time, the underlying critical section is then allocated,
*       initialized and (finally) entered. This allocation and initialization
*       is protected under _LOCKTAB_LOCK. It is _mtinitlocks' job to set up
*       _LOCKTAB_LOCK.
*
*       All other named (non-FILE) locks are also preallocated in _mtinitlocks.
*       That is because a failure to allocate a lock on its first use in _lock
*       triggers a fatal error, which cannot be permitted since that can bring
*       down a long-lived app without warning.
*
*Entry:
*       <none>

*Exit:
*       returns FALSE on failure

*
*       It is not an error to call this on a normal lock which has already
*       been allocated.  It is used to ensure that certain named locks which
*       are not preallocated are available.
*
*       It is also called by _lock, in case any other paths exist which call
*       _lock without calling _mtinitlocknum first.  This is not expected,
*       and can allow fatal _RT_LOCK errors to be issued.

*       Since a failure sets errno to ENOMEM, this should only be called
*       after the per-thread data has been set up (after _mtinit).
